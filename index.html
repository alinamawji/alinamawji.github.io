            <h1>Breast Cancer Incidence and Survival Factors</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the interactive slideshow on breast cancer incidence and survival factors. This 
                presentation will cover various factors that play a role in breast cancer incidence and survival, 
                including age, cancer stage, tumor size, race, and marital status.

                <ul>
                    <li>Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide</li>
                    <li>Certain factors can increase risk, such as age, family history, and 
                        inherited gene mutations</li>
                    <li>Detecting breast cancer early through regular screenings significantly 
                        improves survival rates</li>

            <h2>What is the age distribution of breast cancer cases?</h2>
            <p>You may wonder around what age breast cancer develops. According to the American Cancer Society,
                the median age of breast cancer diagnosis is age 62. 
                This means half of the women who developed breast cancer are 62 years old or younger. This 
                slide shows a graphical representation of breast cancer cases by age group, and segmented by cancer stage.

                    <li>Breast cancer incidence is most common in women ages 40 and older</li>
                    <li>Stage 1 and 2 cancers are the most common</li>

            <h2>Does tumor size play a role in estimated survival time?</h2>
            <p>One measure that is tracked during breast cancer treatment is tumor size. Tumor size
                is a predictor for survival of various cancers, but this is not always the case. This 
                slide shows a graphical representation of tumor size by estimated survival months for breast cancer. 
                It is further segmented by cancer stage.

                <ul>
                    <li>Tumor size does not correlate with the estimated months of survival</li>
                    <li>Generally, as cancer stages progresses (from T1 to T4), tumor size increases</li>
                    <li>Estimated months of survival can be due to other factors</li>

            <h2>Do demographic factors show differences in survival?</h2>
            <p>Once you are diagnosed with breast cancer, you may wonder whether any demographic factors
                correlate with your survival. Some studies have indicated race and marital status
                to be predictors of breast cancer survival. This slide shows a graphical representation of
                either race or marital status by percentage of survival vs death.
